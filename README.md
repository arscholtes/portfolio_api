# Alex Scholtes's Software Engineering Portfolio API
## The basics:

This repository is the api for Alex Scholtes's Software Engineering portfolio, it is paired with a React.js application also located in my repository library on github.

1. Things to know about this api:
   1. This is running on Ruby ~> *3.2.2*,  and Rails ~> *7.0.7*
   2. I am using Postgresql as my DB and that is running on version ~> *1.1*
   3. I am going to add devise and allow people to create a user for this website so you can stay up to date with projects, hackathons and videos/blog posts once those are coming out on a regular basis.
